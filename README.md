# strepto_demography

This repository contains code to run the ABC parameter estimation for samples from *S. pneumoniae* and *S. mitis* as well as the subsequent Ne estimation approach.
This is linked to the article "Long-term evolution of Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus pneumoniae leads to higher genetic diversity within rather than between human populations" from Davison et al. (doi: TBA)
